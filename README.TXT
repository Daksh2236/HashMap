24. The purpose of the HashMap is to store and retreive data with the key-values pairs
    meaning you can look up a value based on it's name or the other way around

25. get(Object key)    
    put(K key, V value)
    values()
    entrySet()
    keySet()
    Yes i think that the same type can be used for both it parameters 
    
26. to check how many entries are in the map you need to use the size(); method
