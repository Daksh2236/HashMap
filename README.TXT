24. The purpose of the HashMap is to store and retreive data with the key-values pairs
    meaning you can look up a value based on it's name or the other way around

25. get(Object key)    
    put(K key, V value)
    values()
    entrySet()
    keySet()
    Yes i think that the same type can be used for both it parameters 
    
26. to check how many entries are in the map you need to use the size(); method

28. When you add an entry to a map with a key that already exist it will replace the last value

29. When you add an entry to a map with two different keys it will be added as a new entry

31. When you try to look up a value that doesnt exist nothing gets printed

32. If you want to print all keys stored in the map you need to print the phoneBook

34. Both are collections and they both have a sort of order but the hashSet is a orfer that it's possibe for the order to no be consistent

35. The difference is the order an array list the order is presercer while in the Hash set it can vary

36. It will call the pickDefaultResponse(); method
